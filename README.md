## Introduction

This repository contains a machine learning model for performing image segmentation on glacier images using the ResNet-50 architecture and PyTorch framework. Image segmentation is the process of classifying each pixel in an image into a specific class, which is essential for tasks like understanding glacier boundaries and ice extent.

The model leverages the power of the ResNet-50 deep neural network architecture, which has demonstrated exceptional performance in various computer vision tasks, and applies it to the specific problem of glacier image segmentation.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get started with using the glacier image segmentation model:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch (installation instructions in the [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/))
- CUDA-enabled GPU (recommended for faster training and inference)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/glacier-image-segmentation.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd glacier-image-segmentation
```

3. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the glacier image segmentation model, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your glacier image dataset. Refer to the [Dataset](#dataset) section for more details.

2. Train the model using the provided script:

```bash
python train.py
```

3. Evaluate the model using the test set:

```bash
python evaluate.py
```

4. Perform inference on new glacier images:

```bash
python predict.py --image_path path/to/your/image.jpg
```

## Model Architecture

The glacier image segmentation model is based on the ResNet-50 architecture. The model takes an input image and produces a segmentation mask, where each pixel is classified as glacier or non-glacier. The ResNet-50 backbone is augmented with additional layers for semantic segmentation.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation should include glacier images along with corresponding pixel-level masks indicating glacier boundaries. Organize your dataset in the following directory structure:

```
dataset/
    ├── train/
    |   ├── images/
    |   └── masks/
    ├── test/
    |   ├── images/
    |   └── masks/
    └── ...
```
