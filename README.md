## Introduction
![CNN Architecture](cnn_architecture.png)

This repository contains a machine learning model for performing image segmentation on glacier images using the pre-trained ResNet-50 model with a U-Net architecture and PyTorch framework. Image segmentation is the process of classifying each pixel in an image into a specific class, which is essential for tasks like understanding glacier boundaries and ice extent.

The model leverages the power of the ResNet-50 deep neural network architecture, which has demonstrated exceptional performance in various computer vision tasks, and applies it to the specific problem of glacier image segmentation.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get started with using the glacier image segmentation model:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch (installation instructions in the [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/))
- CUDA-enabled GPU (recommended for faster training and inference)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mattwaismann/glacier-view-analysis.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd glacier-view-analysis
```

3. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Training

To use the glacier image segmentation model, follow these steps:

1. Download the training data and create a training_data folder with sub-folders named images and masks.

2. Navigato to the training directory:

   ```bash
   cd src/segmentation/training/src
   ```

3. Train the model using the provided script:

    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```
4.  Navigato to the inference directory:

    ```bash
    cd src/segmentation/inference/src
    ```

6. Perform inference on new glacier images:

   ```bash
    python predict.py
    ```

   Sample output

### Inference

To infer the time-series data of a glacier and visualise its area, follow these steps:

1. Download the landsat data folder and paste it in the directory src/earth_engine/
2.  Run the following code with the desired glimsid
   ```bash
   python infer.py --glimsid G007026E45991N
   ```

## Model Architecture

The glacier image segmentation model is based on the ResNet-50 architecture. The model takes an input image of 128x128 pixels with 7 bands, and produces a segmentation mask, where each pixel is classified as glacier or non-glacier. The ResNet-50 backbone is augmented with additional layers for semantic segmentation.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation should include glacier images along with corresponding pixel-level masks indicating glacier boundaries. Organize your dataset in the following directory structure:

```
    training_data/
    ├── images/
    └── masks/
```
